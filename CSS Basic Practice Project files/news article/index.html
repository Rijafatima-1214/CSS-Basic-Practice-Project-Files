    <center><h3>FBR reforms</h3></center>
    <p>
      THE caretaker government is reported to have ramped up the implementation
      of its plans to restructure the Federal Board of Revenue amidst growing
      opposition from within the FBR, as well as from major political parties.
      Media reports suggest that the interim finance minister, Dr Shamshad
      Akhtar, intends to implement the FBR reforms programme through a
      presidential ordinance before the end of this month — less than 10 days
      before the polls. According to some reports, she believes that the reforms
      would boost tax revenue collection from the existing 8.5pc to 15pc in a
      few years’ time. On its part, the FBR bureaucracy is against the plan —
      which was approved by the military-backed Special Investment Facilitation
      Council earlier this month — for fear of losing its infinite privileges
      and having its discretionary powers reduced. The politicians are opposed
      to it on the grounds that the interim set-up does not have the mandate to
      execute policies that can have long-term and far-reaching consequences.
      Hence, they want to leave the decision about FBR reorganisation to the
      next elected government. While there can be no two opinions on the
      constitutional limits of the mandate of the interim set-up, the opposition
      from FBR officials seems to be motivated by selfish reasons. Even if
      reports claiming that the establishment had intervened to bridge
      differences between the minister and top revenue officials are correct, it
      would be a bad move to implement such crucial reforms through an
      ordinance. There is no doubt about the urgency and importance of
      reorganising the Board, separating policy from tax collection, introducing
      technology and reducing the discretionary powers of FBR officials to make
      taxation equitable and fair, as well as boosting collection. But it is
      best to leave this job to the next elected parliament. Should the
      caretakers go ahead with it, the reforms would lose their legitimacy, and
      the new government might have to rescind them even before the execution of
      the plan. The concerns raised by both PML-N and PPP leaders regarding the
      plan are not misplaced. If Dr Akhtar wants the Board to be restructured,
      she must work more extensively on the blueprint of the reforms and leave
      the job of legislating and implementing it to the incoming dispensation.
      Once a policy gets mired in controversy, it is never easy to move ahead
      with it.
